# Presidential-Speech-Analysis

This project examines the text of presidential inaugural addresses using webscrapped data from www.presidency.ucsb.edu. 

The visualization below shows some of the interesting results. The word count is the total amount of times a president said the given word in their inagural address. Below, the speeches were orderd by year so that we can observe how the word count of certain words has changed over time. 

To see more visulizations and code, please view the PDF file.
